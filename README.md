# cloudbrowse
A Soundcloud SDK API hack for finding samples. Type in any keyword and Cloudbrowse will return results that are 30 seconds or less, and have the "Creative Commons Share Alike" licence.
Please feel free to use, or update. You can also just use it to figure out how to talk to Soundcloud with their API. There's a bunch of unused blocks that 
arent being used for anything.

If you use it as a base, please just let me know, or give me a mention!
